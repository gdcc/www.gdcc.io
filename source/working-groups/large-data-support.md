# Large Data Support Working Group

## Motivation and goals

This interest group is for all community members interested in building support for large data in Dataverse repositories.

The number of requests for depositing large datasets into Dataverse-supported installations has increased over the past several years. We need an approach to manage this growth. Efforts to monitor and enforce collection size are underway. The Dataverse Project has committed to support large data and for using Harvard Dataverse as a metadata registry--with data stored elsewhere--as part of its participation in the NIH GREI OTA grant. This working group connects these related concerns and work streams to advance several service categories, policies, and service offerings for supporting large data.

Harvard has worked on intake forms, budget planners, and Globus/NESE download instructions. 

The goals of this group are to:
- Discuss how other Institutions are managing these ["big data" features](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/big-data-support.html),
- Share our learned experiences to improve all of these processes.
