# Sensitive Data Working Group

## Motivation and goals

This interest group is for all community members interested in building support for sensitive data in Dataverse repositories.

We meet roughly quarterly to discuss specific themes and topics related to sharing and archiving sensitive data using Dataverse.  

The goals of this group are to:
- Discuss the unique needs and contexts for sensitive and other regulated data support 
- Share information across the community about policies and best practices for sharing sensitive data


##  Group meetings

We welcome anyone to join our meetings! Meetings are ueually held on a Monday at 1pm Eastern time, and are announced to the [Dataverse Community google group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/dataverse-community) and the #ig-sensitivedata channel in the [Dataverse Community Slack](https://dataversecommunity.slack.com).
