# Sign-Up
The Research and Data Management Core at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is now using iLab, an online system to streamline the process of ordering and billing, for GDCC/DataCite registrations and technical consulting and service requests. This system requires a one-time registration, as discussed below. Through this system, you can
- register for, renew, and pay for your **GDCC membership**;
- register for, add, and pay for **DataCite memberships and DOI registrations**; and
- request and pay for **(technical) Dataverse consulting services**.

## To register for an account:
Download and complete the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uVOauUeUwtpRB2B-r14l_hcSIY8GtmyL/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">registration form</a> and email it to heathl@unc.edu. (Make sure to have your billing information handy, and the name and information of your financial manager—the person who will be paying the invoices.)

Please add no-reply@ilabsolutions.com to your address book; this is the address that invoices will come from.




1. Complete the registration form on the sign-up page, using this link, then email [heathl@unc.edu](mailto:heathl@unc.edu) to let me know that you have registered so that I can approve your registration and send you the necessary contract. Please add no-reply@ilabsolutions.com to your address book at the same time; this is the address that invoices will come from.
2. You will receive a Welcome Email from iLab (typically within one business day) with login credentials.
3. Make sure to have your billing information handy, and the name and information of your financial manager (the person who will be paying the invoices); you’ll need to add them under the "Billing Associations" tab.
4. If you have trouble, watch the following video: [https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6aaa9241-ecf8-474c-a18d-b18f00e0fbc9](https://uncch.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6aaa9241-ecf8-474c-a18d-b18f00e0fbc9)
 
## To Create a Service Request:
Using your iLab login credentials, you can place a service request. 
1. Sign in here using the "Sign in using iLab credentials" option. (It is especially important to use this link if your university already uses iLab!)
2. Enter the credentials received in your welcome email from iLab. 
3. Select the Request Services tab.  (To find the Request Services tab, particularly if your university already uses iLab, you may need to do the following steps: in the main menu, select "Core Facilities"; in the View field, select "Cores at Other Institutions"; search the table for "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"; in the table, click "Research Data Management Core"; and add your phone number in the pop-up window.)
4. To register for or renew GDCC membership, request the "GDCC Membership Application and Registration Fee (GDCC)" service. This will take you to a form for you to fill out. You can also register for DataCite and/or add DOIs at the same time. 
5. Once you submit the request form, your request will automatically be marked "pending review." RDMC will review your request. After the request is approved, you will receive an invoice that includes all the necessary information for payment.
