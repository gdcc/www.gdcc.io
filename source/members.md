# Members
We encourage organizations using the Dataverse software to become a member of GDCC. 

Your GDCC membership helps us
 - coordinate community efforts through interest groups and working groups, pull requests, resources provided through the GDCC GitHub Repositories;
 - support the community on technical and organizational issues through the GDCC Dataverse Repository Installation and Consulting Services, through GDCC support in discussion groups, on Slack, and other channels;
 - provide DOIs through GDCC consortium membership in DataCite;
 - organize community events.

As a GDCC member organization, you will profit from the above benefits. In addition, your employees will profit from reduced rates at Dataverse community events.

We welcome applications from all organizations. You will find the membership form on our [Sign-Up page](https://www.gdcc.io/sign-up.html).
