# About the GDCC

The vision is that the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) will provide international organization to existing community efforts and will provide a collaborative venue for institutions to leverage economies of scale in support of Dataverse repositories around the world. It is our intention that the consortium be community driven and ultimately the goals to be defined by the participants. But recent developments around the need to migrate Digital Object Identifiers and the urgency for several members to join DataCite has accelerated this development and we are happy to say it is going great. While we are eager to begin this important effort, we also recognize that for a global activity of this scale to succeed it will take dedicated planning to make the effort sustainable and to manage expectations.

GDCC was established in 2018 and during its initial phase, three long standing community members, Mercè Crosas from the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University, Peter Doorn from Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in the Netherlands, and Jonathan Crabtree from Odum Institute at the University of North Carolina, served on an oversight committee to get the journey started. Currently, GDCC has a light-weight governance structure consisting of a steering committee with the following members:
- **Philipp Conzett** (chair) from UiT The Arctic University of Norway
- **Jonathan Crabtree** (treasurer) from Odum Institute at the University of North Carolina
- **Stefano M. Iacus** from the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University
- **Steven McEachern** from the Australian Data Archive

**James Myers** is the Senior Developer and Architect for GDCC and community contributions. **Ceilyn Boyd** is the Dataverse Development Project Manager at Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. Ceilyn and James are advising and attending the meetings of the GDCC Steering Committee.
