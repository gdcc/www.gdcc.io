# About the GDCC

The vision is that the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) will provide international organization to existing community efforts and will provide a collaborative venue for institutions to leverage economies of scale in support of [Dataverse repositories around the world][]. It is our intention that the consortium be community driven and ultimately the goals to be defined by the participants. But recent developments around the need to migrate Digital Object Identifiers and the urgency for several members to join DataCite has accelerated this development and we are happy to say it is going great. While we are eager to begin this important effort, we also recognize that for a global activity of this scale to succeed it will take dedicated planning to make the effort sustainable and to manage expectations.

GDCC was established in 2018 and during its initial phase, three long standing community members, Merc√® Crosas from the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University, Peter Doorn from Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in the Netherlands, and Jonathan Crabtree from Odum Institute at the University of North Carolina, served on an oversight committee to get the journey started. Currently, GDCC has a light-weight governance structure consisting of a steering committee with the following members:
- **Dieuwertje Bloemen** from KU Leuven
- **Ceilyn Boyd** from Harvard University
- **Philipp Conzett** (chair) from UiT The Arctic University of Norway
- **Jonathan Crabtree** (treasurer, ex officio) from the University of North Carolina
- **Amber Leahey** (vice-chair) from Scholars Portal / Borealis
- **Dimitri Szabo** from INRAE

**James Myers** is the Senior Developer and Architect for GDCC and community contributions and is advising and attending the meetings of the GDCC Steering Committee.
